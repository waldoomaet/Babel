# Babel
Code (what is left of it) of the 2018 Loyola's Babel project

What probably was the final code is here: https://github.com/waldoomaet/Babel/blob/main/Comunicador_final_UFT/Comunicador_final_UFT.ino

It really is a miracle that this still exists. Found by one of my old teammates, thrown away in a .zip in Google Drive (sorry, was a time when we barely knew about the mere existence of GitHub, let alone to knew that is a really good idea to use it). Also, really sorry for the code written using Spanish :D.

The project was mainly for people with psychomotor/speech disabilities, consisting of a special board, with a screen, some special buttons, the ability to make phone calls (in case of emergencies) and had some pre-recorded, common use phrases. The device had a speaker for the pre-recorder voices, but the thing was even able to use those pre-recorded phrases in the calls.

Also, the project had some neat features that we came up with, at least at the time (later we discovered they already existed, but we still were so proud of 'em):

* Routing the pre-recorded audio to the phone calls
* Combining the buttons with a voltage divider system, that allowed us to register individual presses using only one analog pin.
* Hijacked interface of a Chinese MP3 player using transistors, to programmatically control the pre-recorded phrases (which was unbelievably reliable for how janky and cheap it was)
